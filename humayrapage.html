            <h2 class ="subhead">MY ROLE IN THIS PROJECT</h2>
            <h3 class="para">As the group leader, I am responsible for supervising, allocating responsibilities fairly among the group members,
                and ensuring that ground rules and guidelines are being followed. My role also includes establishing the team's goals, providing the tools and resources 
                 needed to complete the assignment successfully, and providing regular feedback on the team's progress. As the lead I have set numerous meeting times
                 in order to discuss everyones current staus with their tasks, step in and help if anyone is struggling and provide and recieve overall feedback for how the task is going.
                 In addition to this, I am also one of the designers and with that my job is to produce sample designs and protoypes which recieve feedback on, before
                 passing over to Rashid, Wajid and Nadia who will help code the final piece.

            <h4 class="subhead2">ABOUT ME</h4>
            <h5 class="para2">My fascination with technology sparked when, as a child, I went to visit the National Museum of Computing and was left completely in awe of the
             array of obsolete technologies, ranging from arm sized satellite phones to coffee table sized memory discs.
             I find it almost mind blowing how fast society has been transformed and continues to be transformed, 
             by the power of Computer Science. During my A levels it was clear to me that whatever I ended up doing in life I knew I wanted it to
             be within the tech industry, as a young woman of color I have made it my goal to feat the underepresentation of girls who look like me within the 
             industry and rise in male dominated environment. As Gabe Newell, co-founder of Valve Corporation, put it poetically: "The programmers of tomorrow 
             are the wizards of the future." Computer scientists will transform the future of tomorrow and introduce a new perspective to our lives
             and I am determined to actively participate in this challenge.

             I have many hobbies which include baking, running and netflix! 
             <br>
             <br>
             Baking allows me to explore different ingredients and come up with favoursome treats for my family to share. Recently I have fallen
             back in love with running and the peace it provides me when its just me and my headphones, and of course like mst people I spend a lot of 
             time on Netflix and am currently running out of things to watch!
