                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class="info">
                    My name is Wajid Uddin and I am currently a student at the City University of London. Growing up i've always been interested in technology. 
                    I would always have my eyes glued to the screen of a vintage computer moniter playing old website games like Club Penguin or Bin Weevils. As i grew older, 
                    I began to show interest in computer technologies in depth and continued my studies with technology in mind, eventually leading to me picking Computer Science
                    as a subject. I studied hard and eventually ended up in the City University of London where im ow taking a foundation year which revolves around computer Science
                    and computer technologies

                <h2>My Role in this Project</h2>
                <p class="info">
                    By the group leader, Humayra, I've been allocated the role of Web Developer along with Rashid. 
                    Our job was to come up with a design for the main page and recreate it using the programming and web development skills we acquired along this course. 
                    We both decided it would be best if we had one main developer and one supportive one, of which i am the support that helped with any problems along the way. 
                    After a few hours of hard work, we came up with a design that would be both eye catching and immersive for any users of the page.
                </p><br>
    
                <h2>What I have Achieved</h2>
                <p class="info">
                    During my time at the City University of London, I have learned the sufficient skills to create and develop web pages at an intermediate level and to work
                    in a team to create more advanced web pages. One example of a group project i have been a part of is this website you are currently looking at, and two more
                    examples are linked at the top of this page.
