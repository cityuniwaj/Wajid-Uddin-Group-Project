  <h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;padding-top:25px;font-size:20px;">Hello, my name is Nadia Miah and this is my personal page.</h3>
  <h4 style="color:white;text-align:center; padding-top:60px;"> I was born on the 9th of July 2004 in a small town in Italy near Venice. In Italy, I was a professional Basketball player for 3 years and a contemporary rollerskater for 1 year. I moved to London in 2013 and was home schooled for 6 months. I then joined my primary school, Parkhill Junior school in year 5. For my secondary school I went to Isaac Newton Academy, where I completed my GCSEs. Due to the covid outbreak, i wasn't able to sit my actual GCSE exams. After my GCSEs, I studied at the Palmer Catholic academy for my A-levels. I now study at City, University of London where I am currently completing a foundation year in Computer Science. After completing stage 0, I wish to continue to stage 1 at City.</h4>
  <h4 style="color:white;text-align:center; padding-top:25px;">As a person I love to travel and have been to Bangladesh, America, Belgium, France and Austria and I am planning to visit more countries in the future. I love listening to music and love going to concerts and festivals. I've been to 4 concerts so far and have one upcoming. </h4>
  <h4 style="color:white;text-align:center; padding-top:25px;"> I first ever did something related to computer science when I joined a scratch club in year 7 which was something very similar to pencil code. I found it very fun and chose to do it as one of my GCSEs. As my GCSE project I created a program that compresses or expands files.  While doing my GCSEs I decided to persue a career in the computer science field so I decided to take the subject for my A-levels aswell. For my <span style="color:black"> A-level project </span> I created a revision tool to help students of all ages revise. Since joining City, I have created a few web pages such as a <span style="color:black"> CV, </span> travel and movie guide and a restaurant page.</h4>
